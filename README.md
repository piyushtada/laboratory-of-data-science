# laboratory-of-data-science

This project intends to create and populate a database starting from .csv files then create SISS packages to answer questions on a database. After that, we created a cube in Microsoft Analysis Services so that we can do MDX queries on them. In the final stage of the project, we used the cube to create an interactive dashboard to show statistics we got from our cube.
